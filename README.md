Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python program demonstrates the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text messages.

Overview

The Caesar Cipher is among the simplest and oldest encryption methods. It encrypts a message by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt any message with a specified shift value.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt messages encrypted with the same shift value.
